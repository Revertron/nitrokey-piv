# nitrokey-piv

A Rust library for working with the **PIV (Personal Identity Verification) applet** on **Nitrokey 3** devices.  
This crate provides a clean and efficient interface to communicate with and manage PIV keys, certificates, and authentication operations over PC/SC.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üß© **PIV Applet Support** ‚Äî Interact with the PIV applet on Nitrokey 3.
- üîê **Key Management** ‚Äî Generate keys & certificates in PIV slots.
- üßæ **Certificate Handling** ‚Äî Parse and create X.509 certificates.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Cryptographic Operations** ‚Äî Perform signing, encryption, and key derivation using keys in PIV slots.
- üñß **PC/SC Backend** ‚Äî Uses the [`pcsc`](https://crates.io/crates/pcsc) crate for direct communication with the Nitrokey device.

---

## üì¶ Installation

Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
nitrokey-piv = "1.0.0"
```

Or install directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
cargo add --git https://github.com/Revertron/nitrokey-piv
```

---

## üîß Requirements

* **Rust 1.74+**
* **Nitrokey 3** with PIV applet installed and enabled
* **PC/SC runtime**

    * Linux: `pcscd` and `libpcsclite`
    * macOS: built-in support
    * Windows: native Smart Card subsystem

---

## üß† Example

Below is a minimal example that connects to the first Nitrokey device with the PIV applet:

```rust
use nitrokey_piv::Nitrokey3PIV;
use anyhow::Result;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize the PIV context and connect to the Nitrokey reader
    let mut piv = Nitrokey3PIV::open(None)?;

    // Read the PIV applet version
    let name = piv.get_name();
    let serial = piv.get_version();
    println!("Connected to Nitrokey {} with serial {}", name, serial);

    Ok(())
}
```
